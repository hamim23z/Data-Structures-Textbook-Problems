/*
Design and implement a class called circle_location to keep track of 
the position of a single point that travels around a circle. An object 
of this class records the position of the point as an angle, measured 
in a clockwise direction from the top of the circle. Include these public 
member functions:
• A default constructor to place the point at the top of the circle.
• Another constructor to place the point at a specified position.
• A function to move the point a specified number of degrees around the 
circle. Use a positive argument to move clockwise, and a negative argument
to move counterclockwise.
• A function to return the current position of the point, in degrees, measured
clockwise from the top of the circle.

Your solution should include a separate header file, implementation file, 
and an example of a main program using the new class.
