/*
Design and implement a class called clock. A clock object holds one instance
of a time value such as 9:48 P.M. Have at least these public member functions:
• A default constructor that sets the time to midnight
• A function to explicitly assign a given time (you will have to give some thought
to appropriate parameters for this function)
• Functions to retrieve information: the current hour, the current minute, and a 
boolean function to determine whether the time is at or before noon
• A function to advance the time forward by a given number of minutes
