Using the following textbook to complete problems:

DATA STRUCTURES & OTHER OBJECTS Using C++ 4TH EDITION
MICHAEL MAIN - Department of Computer Science University of Colorado at Boulder

I am only completing problems that actually required coding and ones that asked to create a program. 
Other problems are in my notebook.
